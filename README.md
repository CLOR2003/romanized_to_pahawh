#RTP project

This project was made to ease the typing of the pahawh script by allowing users to type in RPA and then convert it into the Pahawh script.

In order to download RTP, go to "releases" on the right and click on it. Then click on "Assets" and click on RTP.exe. After downloading RTP, find it, then double click on it. There will be no notifications or any indicators as to whether it is working or not until one tries typing words out in a document or editor. It is IMPORTANT that the "Noto Sans Pahawh Hmong" font is enabled for ALL editors including notepad and editors from the web(google docs) too or else the characters cannot be rendered correctly onto the document or editor.

Use:
1. To QUIT OR EXIT out of RTP, press the ESC button.
2. After typing RPA such as hmoob, press on the space button for the conversion from RPA to Pahawh to occur.
